# BNotee-server

The server version of [BNotee](https://github.com/BHznJNs/BNotee).

[GitPage](https://bhznjns.github.io/BNotee/dist/)

## Feature

This is a notebook app that you can deploy the
server side on you PC and you can edit your notes by any device with blowser(no IE ;>).

Because of my poor skill, you can not edit the style of inline elements by this program. Therefore, I also call it "poor"-text editor.
